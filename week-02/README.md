## Day-5
- Sum: add numbers together with for cycle.
- Print, Greet: prints the function's parameter
- Factorio: calculates n! with for and recursive cycle
- Double: doubles and prints the function's parameter
- Global Local, More global local, Variables: practicing the global & local variables

## Day-6 & 7
- Arrays 1-3: handling char & int arrays
- User input 1-4: printf, scanf, gets, puts
- Advanced Excercises 1-4:
  1. loading array with values, deleting a specified one
  2. finding the two largest number in an array
  3. filling an array and finding unique elements
  4. filling array with conditions
 - The sieve of Eratosthenes: algorithm to find primes
 - Memoization: storing regular results to save CPU time
  
## Day-8 & 9
 - Anagram: cheks if the given string is an anagram or not
 - Palindrome builder: takes a string, prints itself and appends the reversed form of it to create a pelindrom
 - Palindrome searcher: finds sub-palindroms in a given larger string/text
 - Guess my number: in a user inputted range generates a random number and user can guess it
 - Josephus Problem: he's in trouble, we have to save him. N people standing in a circle and from a starting position (1.) every k-th people are killed. Let's calculate the surviving position as a function of n! The first solution is an algebra way approach, the second solution is "graphical" solution with arrays.
 - Armstrong number: an n-digit number that is equal to the sum of the nth powers of its digits
